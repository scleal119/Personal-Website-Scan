What's highlighted is security measures that I have implemented throughout the process so far

Created a website using apache and html  

Sudo apt update 

Sudo apt upgrade 

Sudo apt install apache2 

Opened web browser and found default apache page 

Replace default page with website index using nano /var/www/html/index.html 

Save changes and change permissions so the files can only be read 

Sudo chown –R www-data:www-data /var/www/html 

Sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config: changed listening port to port 80 

Restart ssh 

Configure firewall to allow traffic to port 80 using sudo ufw allow 80/tcp (install uwf if not already installed using sudo apt-get ufw) 

Sudo ufw allow 443/tcp (HTTPS) 

Test website by searching the raspberry pi ip address on a web browser 

Ran into a few problems with apache, nothing a reboot and upgrade couldn’t fix

Create and register domain name 

Register domain name snoopyreads.com at GoDaddy.com 

Forward domain name to ip address (172.20.10.10) 

Configure apache to allow files to be accessed by snoopyreads.com using  

sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.cof 

Added <Directory "/path/to/your/document/root/.well-known/acme-challenge/"> AllowOverride None Require all granted </Directory> to the text file and saved 

Sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache to install what we will use to get an SSL/TLS certificate for our domain name. This uses HTTPS.  

Sudo certbot – -apache : creates the certificate 

System logs to check regularly:  

/var/log/apache2/access.log and /var/log/apache2/error.log. 

 

Fail2ban blocks IP addresses that repeatedly fail authentication (there is no authentication on our website but it’s still good to have “in case of future progression”) 

sudo apt install fail2ban 

sudo systemctl enable fail2ban 

sudo systemctl start fail2ban
